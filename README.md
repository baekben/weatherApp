# Weather App

In this project I created a weather app using the Open Weather API that informs a user of the
current weather in a particular location.

## Features

- Based on the time at the location the background will be white (day) or black (night)
- Users can select between Imperial and Metric units
- The app gives info such as
  - Temperature w/ high and lows
  - Weather
  - Wind Speed
  - Humidity
